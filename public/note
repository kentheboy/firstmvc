//  　<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
//      this is enables the mod_rewrite 
//      however it is enabled by default
//    Options -Multiviews
//      disabled, since it has '-' in it
//      this avoid the confusion for example 
//      /test or /test.php
//    RewriteBase /firstmvc/public
//      this tells the server the actual root directry
//    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
//    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
//      this tells that when the file is requested 
//      it will request through the following RewriteRule↓↓
//    RewriteRule  ^(.+)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
//      this means the every request will be done through
//      index.php file
//      Thus, if the file was not found it will automatically 
//      rout to the index.php file
//      Also 'url=$1' means to hold url value, '$1'
//      doing this will allow for example,,
//      instead of entering '/public?url=post' in the url bar
//      '/public/post' will be valid url to rout to the same file


//////index.php

//    require_once '../app/bootstrap.php'
//      in many file there are many format that might be required to include 
//      Thus it is important to sum up the required files 
//      connected to one file and inculed that one file 
//      in this case, we connected all the required file 
//      into bootstrp.php file and include that file onece 
//      using 'require_once' statement
